Elwin and Roselyn's server creation attempt:

Our task was to:

1. **Create a node server** that can handle GET requests to three endpoints eg. eg. `/cats` `/dogs` `/unicorns`, returning a different set of data from each 
2. **Create a website** with three buttons
3. **Connect your front end and your backend** - each button should retrieve the data from a different endpoint and display it. Use `fetch` eg. `fetch('http://localhost:3000/cats)`. You will probably get 'CORS' errors here so check out the demo code for ideas on how to resolve that! _Hint: You'll need to set some **headers** for Access Control!_

N.B.  We will not be deploying this for now as we have not learnt how to deploy servers yet so can't use Netlify for this!  Stay tuned for updates, though.
